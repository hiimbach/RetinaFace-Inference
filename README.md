# RetinaFace Inference

This is my practice of ML scripting and inference. 
The original repo of Retina Face is [here](https://github.com/biubug6/Pytorch_Retinaface.git).

To infer the model, run:
```
python test.py
```
The sample image is in the folder sample, and the result of the inference is in the folder sample result.
